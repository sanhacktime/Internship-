# Internship Day 1 – Nmap Scanning

This repository documents my Day 1 activity during the cybersecurity internship.

## Task
Use Nmap to scan and identify open ports on a target system.

## Structure
- `scans/`: Raw output from Nmap scans
- `commands.md`: Commands used and what they do
- `notes.md`: Learnings and observations from Day 1

# Nmap Commands Used

1. `nmap <IP>`  
   Basic scan to detect open ports.

2. `nmap -sS <IP>`  
   Stealth SYN scan to check ports silently.

3. `nmap -A <IP>`  
   Aggressive scan – includes OS detection and more.

# Day 1 Notes

- Learned how Nmap scans for open ports.
- Explored basic and aggressive scanning modes.
- Noticed that different flags provide different levels of detail.
